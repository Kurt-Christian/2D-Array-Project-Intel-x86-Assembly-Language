Reads 16 16bit integer values from the user and places them into a 4x4 matrix.  Allows user to then sum  columns and rows as well as manipulate  the order of the rows.  Will also allow the user to find all values greater or equal to 100.  Uses 1 dimensional array to store values, but uses two registers that serve as a pointer and an offset to access the array as if it were 2dimensional.
